# ESAPI script for VMAT and SBRT plan complexity calculation
Simple ESAPI script to extract complexity metrics for VMAT and SBRT plans

Instructions on how to edit and run the ESAPI script can be found at the tutorial presented at the European Congress for Medical Physics 2022, avaialble online at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffA9Cs6H3u8

Use of the code:
The code was developed for the specific needs of the Radiation Oncology Department of the University Hospital Zurich. By no means, the tests and the validity ranges of the tests should be taken without critical inspection and directly implemented for clinical use. The code is shared "as is" without warranty or responsibility of any type. The proprietary ESAPI libraries should be requested directly to Varian and will not be distributed in this repository.
Support:
The code is shared solely for the benefit of scientific collaboration between Radiation Oncology departments. It may be downloaded, edited and used for no-profit research purposes. The code may not be used for the development of commercial software.
